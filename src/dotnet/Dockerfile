# To build one auto-instrumentation image for dotnet, please:
#  - Download the newrelic dotnet artifacts to `/instrumentation` directory. This is required as when instrumenting the pod,
#    one init container will be created to copy the files to your app's container.
#  - Grant the necessary access to the files in the `/instrumentation` directory.
#  - Following environment variables are injected to the application container to enable the auto-instrumentation.
