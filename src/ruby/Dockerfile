# To build one auto-instrumentation image for Ruby, please:
# - Ensure the packages are installed in the `/instrumentation` directory. This is required as when instrumenting the pod,
#   one init container will be created to copy all the content in `/instrumentation` directory to your app's container.
# - Grant the necessary access to `/instrumentation` directory. `chmod -R go+r /instrumentation`
